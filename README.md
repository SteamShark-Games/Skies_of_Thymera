Coding Etiquette and GitHub Repository Guidelines
By: RJ Rebidoux (200372422)

To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain a clean and organized GitHub repository, please adhere to the following guidelines. 

1.	Setup

1.1 Branch Creation
Whenever you start working for the week, you must first create a separate branch other than main and make sure that the name of your branches is appropriate by incorporating your name and the date of the changes. This helps in identifying the purpose of the branch ensures that you aren't making any changes to the main branch itself. Kindly refrain from creating more than one branch per week.


2.	File Organization 

2.1 Directory Structure
Organize your files into logical directories based on their functionality. A clear and consistent structure helps team members quickly locate files. Any files found somewhere it shouldn’t be, will be deleted. 

2.2 Naming Conventions
Use descriptive names that reflect the content's purpose. Make sure names don't overlap and if a script has been already named/made, do not repeat it. This also applies to game objects within the hierarchy.
Examples:

Good: PlayerController.cs
Bad: pc.cs or controller2.cs or PlayerController2

Good: TimerText
Bad: text or timer or TimerText_Level_1


3.	Script Format

3.1 Code Structure
Utilize to a consistent code structure to enhance readability. Organize your classes and methods logically within each script. Do not edit anyone else’s script, only create functions that don’t exist. If a function is already created on a separate script, make a reference to the script where it is located using an instance.

3.2 Comments
Add comments to explain complex logic, provide context, and show your understanding of the code you create. Ensure that comments are clear and concise so that other programmers can read it.


4.	GitHub Commit Guidelines 

4.1 Commit Messages
Write clear and informative commit messages. Each commit should have a header summarizing the changes and a detailed description when necessary.
 
4.2 Pushes
At the end of the work session, push all of your commits to the branch you created at the start to ensure that your work can be evaluated by the Lead Software Engineer (LSE).

Note: To ensure that the main branch remains buildable and clean of bugs, any unauthorized commits or merges to the main branch will be reverted and progress from that push will need to be redone.


5.	Evaluations and Approvals

5.1 Evaluation process
At the end of the week, every branch will be evaluated to determine if all commits and pushes align with our game standards. To meet the evaluation deadline each week, please ensure that all pushes and commits are submitted to the repository by Thursday (24 hours prior to deadline). If a branch isn’t completed by Thursday of that week, your role will be flagged and addressed during the next scheduled meeting.

5.2 Approvals
When a push/commit is approved, the Lead Software Engineer (LSE) will merge that branch into the main branch, removing the now irrelevant branch from the repository.

5.3 Revisions Needed
If a push/commit needs to be revised, the Lead Software Engineer (LSE) will contact you privately with feedback and action items to be completed within the following day.


By following these guidelines, we can create a well-organized and collaborative coding environment. Thank you for your cooperation and happy coding!
